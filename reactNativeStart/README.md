Simple React Native App comprehensive file structure. Uses Expo to test Android or IOS mobile. No Redux implementation, as the file structure differs based on preference at that point.

After downloading/extracting into a folder, go into same path as package.json and run the following(assuming you have 'yarn' installed):
- yarn install
- (once yarn install is completed) yarn start 

If you don't have yarn installed:
- The line below will install brew on ios computers. Copy the two lines into your terminal.
- The line after will install yarn.
- An alternative if you have sudo. The following line: 'sudo port install yarn'


/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew install yarn
