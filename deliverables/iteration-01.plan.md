# Ratatouille - Team 23

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Jan 18, 2018
 * End date: Feb 8, 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

* We plan to use agile software development, as we want to have a running platform very iteration cycle so that we can make appropriate amends, which is vital given that there are more modifications that can be added beyond the basic scope of the project idea, and we do not have previous experience and hence cannot predict the exact nature of the final product. More specifically we will be using Scrum, a type of Agile approach. 
* Sprint length: 3 weeks.
* Within scrum development, there are 3 roles, product owner, scrum master, and the development team.
* The development team is comprised of the 7 members, which all have access to github and will continually push and pull updates.
* In a usual professional software development environment, the product owner would be the one with the vision of the final product, meanwhile they might appear only at the start and end of each sprint length on a progress update, hence it is the scrum master’s job to handle the day to day activities. The product owner’s role is to understand the deviances that occur as part of the development process and decide on ‘what’ to target(leave the ‘how’ to the scrum master). 
* The scrum master is seen as the middleman between the product owner who understand the concept and the development team, knowing how to manage the members by knowing their strengths and weaknesses. As an example, some members are more adept with the back end process, given this knowledge, the scrum master would seek to capitalize by effectively allocating the tasks(knowing how they should be implemented in code format, which often than not the product owner does not need to be aware). As a side note, giving some of the harder tasks to members who aren’t as experienced in the particular field as others is not always a bad idea, as this may be beneficial in the long term by bringing their skill set up to speed to better facilitate harder implementation which would need work at a later time, and when the time comes working towards a goal of parallel development with team members, to avoid chain development circumstances later in the development cycle. To sum things up, it is scrum master’s role to make sure the deadlines are met of each sprint and keep track of the members current status, in our environment these goals are of the same nature. While none of the members have previous knowledge in the environment that we will be working, note that similarly in the software world, the scrum master isn't always the CTO(Lead Technician), yet its the scrum master’s role to seek his guidance if it is needed and hence in our case for our scrum master to make sure a technical plan of best practices and routes to taken to achieve the goals necessary.


#### Events

* We plan to host a face to face meeting every Friday at around 4 pm in Bahen Building, we will also be having regular online meetings during weekdays and weekends using Skype call to discuss about the project.For each in-person meeting, we will also be hosting code review sessions so that everybody has a chance to see each other’s code and discuss the difficulties encountered during implementation and try to come up with a solution of each problem. In addition, each session has tasks that we must complete, for example, during the first session, our task is to come up at least 4 ideas for the project.
* The purpose of each meeting is to report each other's progress and concerns, and discuss as a group to come up with a solution / alternative. We would also meet up to work together online for writing documentations.


#### Artifacts

* We use Asana (project task board) to log our ideas, discussion notes, tasks and any resources and other project related messages.This is an important step of the project as it acts as a reference guide for us to base upon and research about. In addition, we also use the Facebook group chat for instant checking-in/responses.
* To prioritize the tasks, we would calculate how much hours we have each week, and we would make judgement about how much each tasks takes. For example, if we only have 3 hours on Monday we would do tasks that can be done within 3 hours, while leaving the more difficult tasks until weekend when we have more time. We would also leave 25% of the time for testing purposes (which allocate tasks based on time availability). 
* To be able to make task assignments to team members, we first need to understand each team member’s preference/skillset to assign who will bring the most value to each responsibility, afterwards we assign jobs to each member based on his/her preferred option/ time available, in case of a tie, we will decide using random functions.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks
* The goals for this iteration is to come up and finalize the design stage with an idea for an innovative product and decide the core features as well as the target users. In addition, we need to figure out what programming language/interface we will be using and potentially learn any new skills required for this project. As the guideline, we listed the following tasks to be completed by the end of this iteration.
* Task #1: Start by brainstorming for different random ideas that solve different real world problems. 
* Task #2: Identify the problems we are solving and the target users, come up with varieties of personas that describes the problems that a potential users might face in his/ her daily life. 
* Task #3: Search online for useful resources / APIs and any potential obstacle for implementation.
* Task #4: Chose some top listed ideas that seems reasonable to implement, finalize each idea with core features and present them to the TA for further suggestions
* Task #5: Picks the ultimate idea to continue with and start deciding on the tools and resources that are useful / necessary
* Task #6: Choose and decide on a platform as well as development tool that we will be using for the product.

#### Artifacts
* In order to help develop our product, we plann to make the following two artifacts:
* Create a persona for determining what features are important for the final products; by coming up with a story about a particular end user, we are able to develop our product based on the perspective viewer of the user and we can think about what do we need to implement that is the most useful to the user. 
* Create some product point notes for any features and functions details that we plan to implement to our product, this is an important step because it acts as a rough structure for our project, and with these functions we can further design the overall components based on these features (such as how we will develop UML diagrams).
