# Ratatouille - Team 23

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Jan 18, 2018
 * End date: Feb 8, 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

* We plan to use agile software development, specifically scrum. This will give us a running platform every iteration cycle so that we can make appropriate amends. This will allow us to add modifications beyond the basic scope of the project idea. Since we do not have previous experience with this type of development we cannot predict the exact nature of the final product.

* Each Sprint will last 3 weeks. 

* Within scrum development, there are 3 roles, product owner, scrum master, and the development team.

* Our development team is comprised of 7 members with access to github. Each member will continually push and pull updates.

* In a typical professional software development environment, the product owner would be the one with the vision of the final product. The product owner might appear only at the start and end of each sprint for a progress update. It is the scrum master’s job to handle the day to day activities. The product owner’s role is to understand the deviances that occur in the development process and make the final decisions on ‘what’ to target (leave the ‘how’ to the scrum master). 

* The scrum master is the middleman between the product owner and the development team. The scrum master can manage the  team members with knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. For example, if some members are more adept with back end development, the scrum master will take that into consideration when allocating tasks to capitalize efficiency. The scrum master has knowledge of how code should be implement, which is something the product owner does not typically need to be aware. 

We believe that distributing some of the harder tasks to members who are not as experienced in the particular field compared to others can be beneficial in the long run by enhancing their skill set and facilitating harder implementation in the future. When the time comes where we are working towards a goal of parallel development with team members, we would be avoiding chain development circumstances later in the development cycle. 

Conclusively it is scrum master’s role to make sure that deadlines are met for each sprint and to keep track of the status of the team members. While none of the members have previous knowledge in the environment that we will be working in, note that similarly to the software world, the scrum master is not always the CTO (Lead Technician), yet it iss the scrum master’s role to seek the CTO's guidance when needed and hence in our case for our scrum master to make sure a technical plan of best practices and routes is taken to achieve the goals necessary.


#### Events

* We plan to host a face to face meeting every Friday at around 4 pm in Bahen Building, we will also be having regular online meetings during weekdays and weekends using Skype call to discuss about the project.For each in-person meeting, we will also be hosting code review sessions so that everybody has a chance to see each other’s code and discuss the difficulties encountered during implementation and try to come up with a solution of each problem. In addition, each session has tasks that we must complete, for example, during the first session, our task is to come up at least 4 ideas for the project.
* The purpose of each meeting is to report each other's progress and concerns, and discuss as a group to come up with a solution / alternative. We would also meet up to work together online for writing documentations.


#### Artifacts

* We use Asana (project task board) to log our ideas, discussion notes, tasks and any resources and other project related messages.This is an important step of the project as it acts as a reference guide for us to base upon and research about. In addition, we also use the Facebook group chat for instant checking-in/responses.
* To prioritize the tasks, we would calculate how much hours we have each week, and we would make judgement about how much each tasks takes. For example, if we only have 3 hours on Monday we would do tasks that can be done within 3 hours, while leaving the more difficult tasks until weekend when we have more time. We would also leave 25% of the time for testing purposes (which allocate tasks based on time availability). 
* To be able to make task assignments to team members, we first need to understand each team member’s preference/skillset to assign who will bring the most value to each responsibility, afterwards we assign jobs to each member based on his/her preferred option/ time available, in case of a tie, we will decide using random functions.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks
* The goals for this iteration is to come up and finalize the design stage with an idea for an innovative product and decide the core features as well as the target users. In addition, we need to figure out what programming language/interface we will be using and potentially learn any new skills required for this project. As the guideline, we listed the following tasks to be completed by the end of this iteration.
* Task #1: Start by brainstorming for different random ideas that solve different real world problems. 
* Task #2: Identify the problems we are solving and the target users, come up with varieties of personas that describes the problems that a potential users might face in his/ her daily life. 
* Task #3: Search online for useful resources / APIs and any potential obstacle for implementation.
* Task #4: Chose some top listed ideas that seems reasonable to implement, finalize each idea with core features and present them to the TA for further suggestions
* Task #5: Picks the ultimate idea to continue with and start deciding on the tools and resources that are useful / necessary
* Task #6: Choose and decide on a platform as well as development tool that we will be using for the product.

#### Artifacts
* In order to help develop our product, we plann to make the following two artifacts:
* Create a persona for determining what features are important for the final products; by coming up with a story about a particular end user, we are able to develop our product based on the perspective viewer of the user and we can think about what do we need to implement that is the most useful to the user. 
* Create some product point notes for any features and functions details that we plan to implement to our product, this is an important step because it acts as a rough structure for our project, and with these functions we can further design the overall components based on these features (such as how we will develop UML diagrams).
