# Ratatouille - Team 23

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We want to build a mobile app (iOS/Android)  that provides a peer-to-peer platform for aspiring chefs matched with food enthusiasts for a unique and personal experience. Its main goal is to save time, energy and resources for people with inability to cook and people who have time-consuming work life. It also provides opportunities to build a portfolio for chefs.In addition, it creates a community platform that connects clients (single or group) to chefs based on the type of cooking services, price range, number of people, distance, etc by filtering and tags. All clients and chefs will need to register an account for profile / portfolio records. It also allow chefs / services providers to advertise themselves to the public through hosting online contests. This product will also have profile records and ratings to avoid unnecessary conflicts.  <br /> 
 <br />
Features:<br />
chef/mixologist profile (rating, cuisine specialty, previous work, profile picture, tags [i.e. vegan], available hours)<br />
Eaters profile (rating, phone number, address, payment option)  <br />
Provides advance bookings and when-needed request/lookups.<br />
Allows filters to select specific category of needs (cuisine style, price range, background, size, travel distance, whether ingredients will be provided or not, etc)



#### Q2: Who are your target users?

We basically have two types of target users, one is "eaters" - basically people that want to eat food cooked by chefs because they have little time to cook or they are unable to cook due to physical disabilities, and "chefs" - people that are willing to cook for other people because they are looking to build a portfolio for their career. Here are some examples of who they might be:
An engineering student who has no time or energy to cook, or elderly people with accessibility needs.<br />
A chef that just finish his/her degree and is excited to start his/her career yet continuously hitting walls because most of the dream restaurant requires porfilio.<br />
A person with disability is forced to eat fast foods everyday due to the inability to cook and needs healthy food.
Parties for a group of people, gathering including food and drink serving.<br />
Here is a persona for a potential user for our application:<br />

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

Our competitors include https://www.hireachef.com/. They have a similar goal, however, they require chefs to have professional licenses. One of their advantages is an insurance policy for their services. One of their disadvantages is that they are only accessible through a website and hence they lack engagement with the mobile user base. Additionally, the act of picking chefs does not showcase enough modern clarity (using reviews from a client base, such as a star based rating system, to enable quickly picking between chefs). 

Our service would also be an alternative to ordering pre-cooked food from restaurants. Ordering food from these services (such as Foodora) can lead to food arriving cold. Additionally clients never know what to expect until they have received the food (after ordering and paying for it). Our system would also allow the clients to specify their preferred ingredients based on health issues, dietary restrictions or nutrient content. Clients would also be able to watch the chefs and learn from them for future reference making this a much more informative process than simply ordering food from a restaurant.
