# Ratatouille - Team 23

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Mobile app (iOS/Android) 
Peer-to-peer platform for aspiring chefs matched with food enthusiasts for a unique and personal experience. 
Saving time, energy and resources for people with inability to cook, people who have time-consuming work life.
It provides opportunities to build a portfolio for chefs.
It provides a community platform that connects clients (single or group) to chefs based on the type of cooking services, price range, number of people, distance, etc by filtering and tags. All clients and chefs will need to register an account for profile / portfolio records. It also allow chefs / services providers to advertise themselves to the public through hosting online contests. This product will also have profile records and ratings to avoid unnecessary conflicts.   
 
Features:
chef/mixologist profile (rating, cuisine specialty, previous work, profile picture, tags [i.e. vegan], available hours)
eaters profile (rating, phone number, address, payment option)  
Provides advance bookings and when-needed request/lookups.
Allows filters to select specific category of needs (cuisine style, price range, background, size, travel distance, whether ingredients will be provided or not, etc)



#### Q2: Who are your target users?

We basically have two types of target users, one is "eaters" - basically people that want to eat food cook by the chefs because they have little time to cook or they are unable to cook due to physical disabilities, and "chefs" - people that are willing to cook for other people because they are looking to build a portfolio for their career. Here are some examples of who they might be:
An engineering student who has no time or energy to cook, or elderly people with accessibility needs.
A chef that just finish his/her degree and is excited to start his/her career yet continuously hitting walls because most of the dream restaurant requires porfilio.
A person with disability is forced to eat fast foods everyday due to the inability to cook and needs healthy food.
Parties for a group of people, gathering including food and drink serving.
Here is a persona for a potential user for our application:
