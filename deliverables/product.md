# Ratatouille - Team 23

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We want to build a mobile app (iOS/Android)  that provides a peer-to-peer platform for aspiring chefs matched with food enthusiasts for a unique and personal experience. Its main goal is to save time, energy and resources for people with inability to cook and people who have time-consuming work life. It also provides opportunities to build a portfolio for chefs.In addition, it creates a community platform that connects clients (single or group) to chefs based on the type of cooking services, price range, number of people, distance, etc by filtering and tags. All clients and chefs will need to register an account for profile / portfolio records. It also allow chefs / services providers to advertise themselves to the public through hosting online contests. This product will also have profile records and ratings to avoid unnecessary conflicts.  <br /> 
 <br />
Features:<br />
chef/mixologist profile (rating, cuisine specialty, previous work, profile picture, tags [i.e. vegan], available hours)<br />
Eaters profile (rating, phone number, address, payment option)  <br />
Provides advance bookings and when-needed request/lookups.<br />
Allows filters to select specific category of needs (cuisine style, price range, background, size, travel distance, whether ingredients will be provided or not, etc)



#### Q2: Who are your target users?

We basically have two types of target users, one is "eaters" - basically people that want to eat food cooked by chefs because they have little time to cook or they are unable to cook due to physical disabilities, and "chefs" - people that are willing to cook for other people because they are looking to build a portfolio for their career. Here are some examples of who they might be:
An engineering student who has no time or energy to cook, or elderly people with accessibility needs.<br />
A chef that just finish his/her degree and is excited to start his/her career yet continuously hitting walls because most of the dream restaurant requires porfilio.<br />
A person with disability is forced to eat fast foods everyday due to the inability to cook and needs healthy food.
Parties for a group of people, gathering including food and drink serving.<br />
Here is a persona for a potential user for our application:<br />

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

Our competitors include https://www.hireachef.com/. They have a similar goal, however, they require chefs to have professional licenses. One of their advantages is an insurance policy for their services. One of their disadvantages is that they are only accessible through a website and hence they lack engagement with the mobile user base. Additionally, the act of picking chefs does not showcase enough modern clarity (like using reviews from a client base, such as a star based rating system, to enable quickly picking between chefs). 

Our service would also be an alternative to ordering pre-cooked food from restaurants. Ordering food from these services (such as Foodora) can lead to food arriving cold. Additionally clients never know what to expect until they have received the food (after ordering and paying for it). Our system would also allow the clients to specify their preferred ingredients based on health issues, dietary restrictions or nutrient content. Clients would also be able to watch the chefs and learn from them for future reference making this a much more informative process than simply ordering food from a restaurant. 

Another one of our competitors is blueapron.com/chefsplate. Where clients can get weekly and daily recipes with fresh ingredients delivered to their doors. They then use these components to cook for themselves at home. Similarily our clients will benefit from the fresh ingredients however they save a lot of cooking time. The Blue Apron web application forces clients to take part in a plan. We would not be constricting our clients to a monthly price and our application would be completely free of commitment.

### Highlights

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
and/or collaborative process.

 * Short (5 min' read max)
 * Decisions can be related to the product and/or the team process.
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Present the arguments for each alternative.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your team/product/users.
 * Essentially, we want to understand how (and why) you ended up with your current product plan.
 
As a team we had difficulty finding ideas that were not previously implemented.
The followin are alternatives we considered. 

An app that picked wine based on the user's meal. We did not pursue this idea because it did not convincingly solve a real world problem.  

An allergy avoidance checker. We did not expand on this idea because most people know their allergies and how to avoid the (i.e. can check ingredients in products before use or purchase). Additionally, it is very difficult to find a database that contains the ingredients for almost all of the product on the market. We also lack required medical information as we are not medical professionals. 

An schedule combinning application. We did not followe through with this idea due to the excessive number of competitors. We had difficulty finding fetures that uniquely enhanced such an interface. We were not able to find a solution to a problem that had not already been solved by the other competitors

A fitness/diet helper application. Myfitnesspal is a very already a strong competitor on both web and mobile platforms with complete features and already hueg user databases.

A application that scans/analyzes receipts/cheques and makes report for the IRS or other financial services for contractors. A big variety of companies are already doing this, there is heavy competition and a heavily occupied market.

We reached our current idea after being inspired by the convenience of using uber and our needs as students to eat healthy while saving money and time (this is a healthier alternative to foodora and its other competitors). Our product would allow its users to control their ingredients, by either choosing to specify them to the chefs or providing them based on what is already have available to them at the moment.

We choose to develop our application on IOS platform because:
Web application are not as easy to use as a phone application, in addition, a web application would need access to a PC whereas mobile applications can be used anywhere any time due to how extensively cell phones are used nowadays. Mobile applications provide a more instant approach compared to other catering options that are currently only available on web applications. 

When comparing android and IOS, the user base is dominantly using IOS platform in US, and Canada, which is the area that we will be targeting. Secondly from a monetary perspective, IOS statistically has a higher revenue stream from advertisements and users who are willing to pay when compared to users on the Android platform, which is vital to have users that will be engaging with the services we intend to provide.
