# Ratatouille / team 23 

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: February 22, 2018
 * End date: March 11, 2018

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

* We will first identify the number of tasks (such as page views and functions) that are most important.
* Then distribute the tasks equally to each member as the responsibilities based on member's preferences and how much spare time they have.
* During the initial meeting, each of us will play a role in sharing and discussing ideas regarding to UI design and the specific functions for each of application page.
* After the initially meeting, we decided to implement views and functions for pages including log in / registration page, dashboard profile for service provider accounts, past order history for client accounts, service search page, message page and account setting page. 
* We then decided to assign each of the above tasks as follows: Log in/ Registration (Helen), Search Page (Vlad), Profile for clients (Mariko),Profile for service provider(Akanksha),Message page (Emil) and account setting page (Mike).


#### Events

We planned to host the following meetings during this iteration:
 * In person meeting - Feb 27th: Decide on a UI and distribute features to individual members to code.
 * In person meeting - March 1st: Coding session + review code + UI graphical layout designs 
 * In person meeting - March 9th: Progress result exchanges and some discussion relating to message function and problems encountered.
 * Online meeting - March 11th: On Skype call, each group member will discuss any final concerns and gather together to finalize the video and deliverable paperworks.


#### Artifacts

* By using the Task-Board feature on Asana, we create a sub-board with the meeting date as the name and log any notes / tasks that needs to be done as the tab that falls under the board.
* Any meeting schedules or extra notices will also be posted as tabs under the meeting date.
* The priority of tasks will be specially mentioned in the task tab to indicate its importance. 
* Tasks distributed in the meetings will be organized on Asana as log notes by priority. Tasks will be assigned to members based on their expertise and interest in the function. 

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.
 
 * Since we plan to split out tasks equally and each of them are independent in files, we will be less likely to encounter conflicts in codes. Therefore our Git workflow focuses majorly in commiting to the master branch within the product directory.
 * Our current project product directory is named as "reactiveNativeStart" as we are now developing our project from the code mock up prototype.
 * Each member is responsible to create the necessary file and implement the functions within that file. Then commiting and pushing the new file to the product directory in the master branch.
 * If we encounter any conflicts in code, the member is responsible to reach to the other and discuss whose part to keep for final version.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

* The goal is to produce a working application of our project with some of its most important and basic functionalities included. The functions (as listed on Asana) are: Login page, Registration page, Account pages, Profile pages, Message board, Search page. 
 

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
   
* We will produce sketches of the UI design during the course of several personal meeting and potentially online meetings.
* In addition, we will also provide screenshots of the discussion board (Asana) we use to brainstorm features of different pages.
