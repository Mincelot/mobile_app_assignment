# Ratatouille - Team 23

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Feb 8 2018
 * Where: GB 303

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

1. We consider that the weekly meetings have been quite successful for the past few weeks since the semester started despite not having fixed criteria, all the while being productive in the way we spent our time and efficient in using the limited amount of hours that were available at our disposal to accomplish key decisions. As an example, of our first meeting, it involved brainstorming many ideas about what our product might be. The listing of these possible concepts gave us the confidence to proceed to the next steps once we decided on an idea knowing its value in comparison to our listed alternatives. The screenshot below is from our Skype call, which became our preferred method of communication after encountering problems when using facebook voice chat, as it failed to detection some of the group member's microphones: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AzWfTgr.png) <br />
2. The Anasa(website/mobile application) task board turned out to be a useful and effective tool in its array of multiple layouts and possible ways to organize tasks. We used it often to record our ideas about the project as well as recording resources that we think would become useful to building towards the product. Below is a screenshot of our task board from the website: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RxB1oYD.png)<br />


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Even though we have decided what roles and responsibilities should be fulfilled, we haven't decided on which members will be given what positions, as this requires further knowledge of how our group memberâ€™s interact with one another in order to understand who would be better suited for the roles given their personality inclinations. We have not decided who will be the scrum master or the scrum project owner for this project as of the time being. <br />
2. In terms of calculating the time we have not been keeping track of what time each member has been spending every week devoted to the project, and the possible potential of possible work hours on a per week basis by our team. We can infer this is probably due to the fact that we are not in the coding phase as of currently, and hence are attributing time without an iron fist mentality. Once all the members have started working on coding the product, we will include exact specifications of hours related to tasks that need to be solved.


#### Planned changes

So far we are not making any changes to our original process plan.


## Product - Review

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 For task 2, see the link in product.md for the link to persona.

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
