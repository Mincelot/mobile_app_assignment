# Ratatouille - Team 23

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Feb 8 2018
 * Where: GB 303

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

1. The weekly meeting is quite successful for the past few weeks since semester started because each meeting was very productive and efficient. For example, the first meeting we had we brainstormed many ideas about what our product might be and eventually those ideas give us inspirations to what to have finally decided to do for the project. Here is a screenshot of our skype calling: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AzWfTgr.png) <br />
2. The Anasa task board turned out to be useful and effective. We used it very often to record our ideas about the project as well as record resources that are useful to building the product. Here is a screenshot of our task board: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RxB1oYD.png)<br />


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Even though we have decided what roles and responsibilities should be fulfilled, we haven't decided on who will be on what position. For example, we have not decided who will be the scrum master for this project. <br />
2. In terms of calculating the time we have not been really keeping track of what time each member have everyweek. But this is probably due to the fact that we are not in the coding phase yet so the tasks are not very time consuming.


#### Planned changes

So far we are not making any changes to our original process plan.


## Product - Review

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 For task 2, see the link in product.md for the link to persona.

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
