# Ratatouille / team 23

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Mar 15 2018
 * End date: Mar 30 2018

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

 * At most 3 items
 * Start with the most significant change
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it
 * Ideally, for each change, you will define a clear success metric (i.e. something you can measure at the end of the iteration to determine whether the change you made was successful)

 > *Note:* If you are not making any changes to your process, it means that you are happy with all of the decisions you made in the previous iterations.
 > In this case, list what you consider to be the most significant process decisions your team made. For each decision, explain why you consider it successful, and what success metric you are using (or could use) to assert that the decision is successful.
 
 The most significant process decision our team made is that we distribute the work equally based on member's preferences and how much spare time they have. This decision is successful because it make sure that we won't run into the situation where a member is assigned with a task but he/she could not complete it on time due to lack of skill. In addition, it helps us to make significant progress during the final few week of school when all of us are busy with other courses since each of us are comfortable with the assigned task.

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

The tasks/features assigned to each members are as follow:
* Helen (Ke Lan): Review submission page
* Vlad: Chat page
* Mariko: Display page for the reviews
* Akanksha: Itinerary form
* Emil: The video, map page
* Mike (Yu Xuan): Favourite page

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the **purpose** of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.
 
 Frequent small "meeting" on Facebook where we disgussed about problems we faced during coding.
 In person meeting Mar 15 2018: Discuss what features should be implemented for this iteration as well as assigning tasks.
 In person meeting Mar 29 2018: Code review session.
 Skype meeting March 30 2018: Finalize all the features as well as solving coding or design problems.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be to-do lists, task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   
 * Again we will be using the task-board on Asana, we create a sub-board with the meeting date as the name and log any notes / tasks that needs to be done as the tab that falls under the board.
 * Notes from in person meeting that indicates the task assigned to each memeber.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.

Our Github workflow did not changed from the last iteration. We use the basic git workflow for our project, that is, test code locally -> pull from master -> commit -> push to master. We chose this type of workflow due to the structure of our project: each functionality is separated into different files so we rarely run into conflicts if we work simultaneously. In addition, this gives us a faster workflow since we don't need to have one person that reviews every commits.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.
 
 * The goal for this iteration is to finish all the features for our app that we planned to do from iteration-01, we specifically want to prioritize the functions that were supposed to be finished in iteration-02.
 * Task 1: Initial meeting to discuss the general direction for this phase of the project, resolve questions related to android studio.
 * Task 2: Get familiar with using android studio because we ejected from EXPO, which means to test our code, the procedure is more complicated and time consuming.
 * Task 3: Distribute the remaining features for the app to group memebers.
 * Task 4: Make sure all of the features are done and tested.
 * Task 5: Minor tweaks to UI design if have time.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
   
  * Similar to last iteration, the main artifact for this iteration will be the complete code for our application, however, our code will be mainly supported on Android.
  * We will produce some UI design sketches for some of the features implemented in this iteration.
  * In addition, we will provide screenshot of our discussion on Facebook on different matters, such as coding problem or design problem.
