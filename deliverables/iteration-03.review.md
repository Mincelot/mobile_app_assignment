# Ratatouille / team 23

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: APRIL 1st, 2018
 * Where: ONLINE (SKYPE)

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 
* The most important process that turned out to be successful is the decision of switching the task of message (chat) and map page in between our group members and that we are able to achieve the complete state of our application. By complete state it refers to 95% of our initially planned functions are live-working on both front end and back end. 
* In fact, our message function plays a crucial role in placing / inquiring about an order. Thus without making this decision, we will not be able to finish this function on time, nor that we will even have a complete working product.
* The second process that turned out to be successful is the decision of distributing tasks based on member's skills and spare time.
* This decision is successful because by distributing the tasks based on experiences and available time, we do not over-stress team members on the amount of workload and this improved our process efficiency in terms of having each member taking a share in developing the application in parallel (although each member still has a great amount of work to do, this decision is way better than leaving everything for one experienced member and have all other members left with little/no contribution).


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
 * The decision of ejection from EXPO to Android Studio may not be as successful as we have expected.
 * Ideally, we expected the switching from EXPO will not only resolve compatibility problems but also retains the simplicity of testing.
 * Although this ejection did resolve the problem of incompatible library import issues, it costed a great time for the team members to set up the bread new virtual testing device as well as the time it takes to relaunch the server everytime we test the application. However this decision is necessary and we admit the tradeoff between time and a working product result is reasonable.
 * The second decision that did not turned out so well ()



#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
 
 * Since this is the last iteration before submitting the final product, we barely have any time to make process-related changes and to perform these change decision.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 
 * Following is the list of tasks that are completed:
 * Task 1: Initial meeting to discuss the general direction for this phase of the project, resolve questions related to android studio.
 * Task 2: Get familiar with using android studio because we ejected from EXPO.
 * Task 3: Distribute the remaining features for the app to group members.(as displayed in Asana screenshot)
 * Task 4: Make sure all of the features are done and tested.(to be updated)
 * Task 5: Minor tweaks to UI design (changing CSS style of header, improved layout of lists)
 * Task 6 (not part of initial iteration plan): Added star rating property to services providers as additional component of reviews.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
 
 * We claim that most of the goals and tasks planned are completed.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
 
 * Since this is our last iteration of this project, we will barely have any chance for further insights of this application.
 * However in scope of outside the course, we may still continue to develop this application by making the current feature more robust and secure (i.e. robust as in platform compatibility across desktop, Android and IOS, whereas secure as in introducing background/licence checks, etc.)
